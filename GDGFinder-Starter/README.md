# Summary

- Use themes, styles, and attributes on views to change the appearance of views.
- Themes affect the styling of your whole app and come with many preset values for colors, fonts, and font sizes.
- An attribute applies to the view in which the attribute is set. Use attributes if you have styling that applies to only one view, such as padding, margins, and constraints.
- Styles are groups of attributes that can be used by multiple views. For example, you can have a style for all your content headers, buttons, or text views.
- Themes and styles inherit from their parent theme or style. You can create a hierarchy of styles.
- Attribute values (which are set in views) override styles. Styles override the default style. Styles override themes. Themes override any styling set by the `textAppearance` property.
