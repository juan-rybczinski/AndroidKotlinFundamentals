### Navigation Host Fragment

A *navigation host fragment* acts as a host for the fragments in a navigation graph. The navigation host fragment is usually named [`NavHostFragment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/fragment/NavHostFragment).

### Options Menu

> **Tip:** Make sure that the `ID` of the menu item that you just added is exactly the same as the `ID` of the `AboutFragment` that you added in the navigation graph. This will make the code for the `onClick` handler much simpler.
